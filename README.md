#Capstone - NYC_Vision_Zero
A brief analysis of the Vision Zero Initiative started in 2014 to curb motor vehicle collision deaths.

**Conclusion:**
While overall traffic deaths continued on its pre-program trajectory, pedestrian and cyclists faired far worse after Vision Zero was implemented. There are a number of factors that seem to be perfect examples of multicollinearity, the main one being the intoduction of the CitiBike program in 2013.

**Future Analyses:**
- Pedestrian/Cyclists collisions and resulting injuries/fatalities
- Follow traffic collisions as the CitiBike program progressed outward from Manhattan, perhaps looking at zip code or borough grouped data
- Swedish numbers seemed to steadily decline until leveling off ~15 years after the program started. Forecast where NYC numbers might level off using some form of modeling (linear regression seems the most logical)

** The second notebook is the work that I started on the NYC reservoir project. I was hoping to utilize local weather reports and compare the reservoir levels to see which factors resulted in the biggest impact on water reserves. This notebook is incomplete, but does show where I started and my plan of attack. I do plan on finishing this in the near future. **
